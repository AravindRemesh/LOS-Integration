# LOS-Integration
Line of sight integration of spherical wedge in space.

The Python script is designed to process data from a .sav file, perform various data transformations, interpolate the data, and create a scatter plot to visualize the results. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

1. **Data Loading and Transformation**:
   - It reads data from a .sav file, which is typically used to store data in IDL (Interactive Data Language) format.
   - The script extracts relevant data columns such as radius (r), polar angle (theta), azimuthal angle (phi), density (rho), and temperature (Temp).
   - The data is then transformed from spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) using the `sph2cart` function.

2. **Line-of-Sight Integration**:
   - The script integrates data in the x, y, and z directions.
   - The integration involves averaging data along these directions, which is later used for interpolation.

3. **Interpolation**:
   - The data points are interpolated using linear interpolation in 3D space.
   - Linear interpolation allows the script to estimate values at intermediate points between the data points.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - The code performs additional data analysis, including applying a function (`f`) to the interpolated temperature values.
   - It calculates a quantity, `int_value`, based on interpolated density and temperature data.

5. **Visualization**:
   - The final part of the script creates a scatter plot.
   - The x and z coordinates are on the plot's axes, and the color is determined by `int_value`, reflecting the integral of certain data properties.

6. **Result Presentation**:
   - The scatter plot is displayed to visualize the integral values with color-coded data points.

This code represents a data processing and analysis pipeline, taking data from spherical coordinates, transforming it, and producing a visual representation of integrated data. It's worth noting that the code makes use of various libraries and functions, such as SciPy and pandas, to manipulate and analyze the data efficiently.
